Title: Analyzing the Impact of Global Collaboration on Review Speed in Software Development Projects


In today's fast-paced software development landscape, collaboration is key. The pandemic has even more than ever shifted how developers work, now being a very common choice to only collaborate remotely, and one will no longer find it strange when an American hires a Polish via Linkedin to help him with a database solution. The teams are as distributed and diverse as they ve ever been, yet the opportunities are not free from challanges. In this post, we share our research findings on the relationship between pull requests and timezones. Sounds confusing? Let’s explore more in the following paragraphs.

Global collaboration in software development refers to projects that involve contributors from diverse geographical locations. These projects often benefit of many perspectives and expertise from contributors from all around the world. 
However, this also adds unique challenges, such as communication barriers, timezone variations, and cultural differences. 

At the heart of this collaboration lies GitHub, a pivotal platform that fosters seamless cooperation across diverse teams. Established in 2008, GitHub has emerged as the go-to choice for collaborative software development, offering tailored tools and features such as pull requests, issue tracking, and project management. With its intuitive interface, mobile application, and extensive ecosystem of integrations, GitHub stands as a cornerstone in facilitating transparent communication, efficient code review, and workflow management, serving both organizations and open-source communities alike.

For this project, we are looking at the following metrics that can give us some insights about how this issue is generated. We are looking to see if pull request are linked with timezones. 

The review of a pull request is the signal that  the code developed by another colaborator can succesfuly be integraded into the existing work. For a pull request to be reviewed, it has to be acknowledged by project maintainers, senior developers, or designated code reviewers. In some cases, a pull request may be reviewed and merged within hours or even minutes, while in other cases, it may take days or weeks for the review process to complete. Generally, however, many teams aim to complete reviews within a few days. The duration is not only impacted by the complexity of the project, but it can also he subjected to other less aknowledged factors, including the geographic distribution of collaborators. Projects with a diverse team spanning multiple time zones may experience slower review speeds due to communication challenges and coordination issues. Those challanges also include language barriers, cultural differences, and differing work schedules.

By analyzing 51 python projects focused on deep learning, xxx pull requests and colaborators from xx countries and xx timezones, we have…..
